<b><h2>Part 1</h2>
These are the events of a certain day.
<br><br>"Eeh!? Then, at Rias-san’s place too!?"
<br><br>"Yes, for the time being we are a family from where a Maou was selected, so they made us a candidate before anything else. Seems like they did something similar at Irina's place too".
<br><br>"......Anyway, without a doubt, this is just an unreasonable demand that suddenly flashed in Odin-sama's mind and he pushed it at the Three Great Powers".
<br><br>From the morning in the living room, Irina and Rias were with surprised faces, and a little angry Rossweisse-san was exchanging opinions.
<br><br>"What happened?"
<br><br>I asked the three of them. Xenovia who was energetically eating a piece of Roll cake with her bare hands, responded.
<br><br>"Looks like a message from Asgard───the Norse faction suddenly came to Heaven and the Underworld. They're going to make an exhibition in Valhalla".
<br><br>Exhibition......? Furthermore, in the Norse realm?
<br><br>"An exhibition is it? So why are they surprised? They look a little panicked too".
<br><br>That's right, Rias and Irina look surprised, and a little panicked too. As if they were suddenly requested something. Asia said.
<br><br>"I heard that they want to do an exhibition to embody the alliance’s peace. It looks like everyone from the Norse faction wants to open a Pavilion connected with Heaven and the Underworld".
<br><br>From here; I received explanations from Asia and Xenovia.
<br><br>Looks like the Norse faction suddenly wants to hold an exhibition, and they want to establish a Pavilion with Heaven and the Underworld (the Fallen Angels included as well). And they are sounding out the intentions of the Three Great Powers.
<br><br>The Angel and Devils’ side felt that it would be a good opportunity to introduce the Grigori, so the Three Great Powers gladly accepted it. The details of every Pavilion seem to have been decided one by one by the higher-ups,' but coming here, the Norse side wanted to expand the scale of the exhibition a little.
It's good that it became bigger, but as there was nothing decided to do there, it became a free area.
<br><br>If Heaven and the Underworld want to set another Pavilion there, then they have permission. If another faction from the alliance wants to attend, then that is ok too. Because of this, at this critical moment, every faction started aiming for the Pavilion.
<br><br>Because a new appealing place was created, everyone wanted to participate. Basically, because everyone from the alliance can participate in the exhibition, the Norse exhibition became the best place to promote themselves to the other factions.
<br><br>An order from the higher-ups came to the Devils and the Reincarnated Angel; Irina.
<br><br>───Make the free area yours.
<br><br>It was decided that the Pavilion prepared at the start of the exhibition would be able to display anything that the participants wanted. Nevertheless, that doesn't mean we can just hand it over silently; if that's the case, it should be fine to make it a place to introduce the new young faces of the of Heaven and the Underworld───
<br><br>"......In the end, they mean this: If the others are going to take the free area, It's better to let the promising young ones struggle over it".
<br><br>Koneko-chan said that while biting a chocolate bar. However, Rias affirmed after sighing.
<br><br>".....That's just their official stance. I heard that there's space sufficient to make Pavilions for everyone. It seems to be able to show off all of the local specialities​ of Devils only there. Even so, they came asking for us to take the free area...... They probably don't really want anyone else to take it, but......their real intention is to see what kind of establishment we; the young ones, are going to make in the free area; they plan to make us a spectacle. I was told that the higher-ups decided to make a presentation contest​ in their presence...... Anyway, I'm absolutely sure that Onii-sama and Azazel decided this with Odin-sama in the background".
<br><br>......Ah, so it's something like that.
<br><br>After listening to Rias’ words, I understood the background of why the Three Great Powers were ordering the young ones to take the free area is.....for the enjoyment of the higher-up of every faction!
<br><br>Starting with Sirzechs-sama, Serafall-sama, Azazel-sensei and Michael-sama, they probably would like to see the strenuous effort​s of the young ones, while watching attentively​ over us.
<br><br>Then, Odin-jiisan, who really understood this type of talk, came running...... And so they prepared a place for this worthless competition!
<br><br>Because Rias, Irina, and Rossweisse understand this, they became perplexed......
<br><br>"So that means that it's alright for us to establish a Pavilion in the free area?"
<br><br>Kiba asked Rias. Rias responded while nodding.
<br><br>"Yes, at least I think so. The people from the other places are probably thinking the same thing too".
<br><br>Irina crossed her arms and said while shaking her head.
<br><br>"......I'm going to participate in this presentation contest as well, so I plan to make a Pavilion too. But, I'm going to decide what I'll be going to display there with my reincarnated Angel comrades".
<br><br>I wonder what the Pavilion of the young reincarnated Angels is going to be? I can't even imagine it. Rias too, while putting her hand on her chin, said.
<br><br>"......Even if they say that it is a presentation contest, I wonder if it’s alright to introduce the specialities of Gremory before Onii-sama and Odin-sama? They would be troubled if I suddenly touched on this matter​".
<br><br>Sirzechs-sama is probably looking forward to the content that this troubled Rias is going to submit......
<br><br>───Then suddenly , Rossweisse-san vigorously stood up​ .
<br><br>"Now that it has come to this, I'll directly invade Valhalla and complain to Odin-sama! After all, the fact that I'm not there anymore is a good thing for him and he's doing whatever he pleases! There's no doubt about this! He probably decided this while touching the butt of my successor Valkyrie! There's no doubt about this! I definitely won't forgive him!"
<br><br>Somehow, as if everything that was accumulated exploded, Rossweisse-san entered an enraged state!
<br><br>Because she worked under that Jii-san before, when Jii-san tries to meddle with us, she becomes extremely enraged. You could feel her vigour as if she would invade Valhalla but suddenly several people appeared at this place!
<br><br>"You'll have to wait".
<br><br>"Yes, I agree​".
<br><br>"Yes, you shouldn't live recklessly".
<br><br>Three voices! Looking at them it was: Sairaorg-san, Seekvaira-san and the ex-kaichou; Sona-senpai.
<br><br>It was the lineup of the leading young Devils!
<br><br>"Sairaorg! What happened so suddenly?"
<br><br>Rias was surprised at the entrance of her cousin. Sairaorg-san suddenly started laughing.
<br><br>"Well you see, the command to usurp the free area came to our places too.. So I was a little curious, and I came to see the situation you guys were in.".
<br><br>Seekvaira-san said with her glasses shining.
<br><br>"In the presentation, we will all be rivals. But before that, I thought that we could at least greet each other. Well, I thought that all of us would get confused due to these sudden orders".
<br><br>Ex-Kaichou Sona said while sighing.
<br><br>"......The abuse of power from those above didn't start today, but......now that it's decided there's nothing we can do. Rias, you aren't alone you know?"
<br><br>With the claim of a contemporary [Rookie Four] like her, Rias looked a little moved. That's right, this challenge​ wasn't pushed only on Rias.
<br><br>Sairaorg-san too, showing consideration to Rias said.
<br><br>"However, it's a reality that this will become a good experience for our territories. Looks like the space of the free area is small, but if we were to take it in our hands, it would probably become a huge appeal for my Bael territory. And as someone from the house of the Great King too, we can't ignore this. Although it's a sudden unreasonable demand, it could be said to be a good opportunity for us young ones too".
<br><br>It was an opinion fitting from someone positive like Sairaorg-san. As a challenge from the higher-ups to the young ones, he probably will gain many points for thinking that this is a suitable place to raise the appeal of the territory he's leading.
<br><br>The ex-Kaichou Sona and Seekvaira-san said with the same view in one voice​ "That's right". Moreover, someone else appeared in this place too.
<br><br>"Fuu, so you guys will come out too".
<br><br>It was the bastard, Vali! He's a bastard who appears in unexpected places and at unexpected moments, but to think he would show himself now! As expected, when someone completely unexpected appeared, everyone became surprised, but he said without caring.
<br><br>"Azazel told me too. To make that free area or something mine".
<br><br>I was thinking about why this guy would do it. Come to think of it, this guy became an adopted son of Odin-sama, right? It wouldn't be weird for the Azazel-sensei side to talk with the Odin-sama side about this too......
<br><br>"Ho, you want to make a Pavilion too?"
<br><br>That was my question. This guy who is only interested in fighting, so by no means would he want the free area. Did he receive some kind of instruction? Does he plan to establish something like a petting party for Fenrir and Gogmagog?
<br><br>"Since I exchanged the vow of becoming the adopted son of Odin, I need to make my adopted father look good​".
<br><br>......This is an attitude really admirable from this guy. No, originally he would definitely say he's not interested and avoid it......somehow, is there something behind this?
<br><br>Hearing the opinions of those who plan to aim at it, Rias’ eyes instantly flared up.
<br><br>"......If you guys say something like this, then I won't step back. It's alright, the tendency of the young ones to compete among each other is not bad. Rossweisse".
<br><br>"Yes, what do you want, Rias-san?"
<br><br>Rias told Rossweisse-san.
<br><br>"It's alright to not say anything to Odin-sama. I think that this free area usurpation war is a good thing to raise the morale of the team members of [D×D]. It's not only Sona, Sairaorg, and Seekvaira. There’s Irina and Vali too. We won't lose to any of you guys. This competition; we of the Gremory family will take it!"
<br><br>[[[[[!!!!!]]]]]
<br><br>Hearing this declaration of war from Rias, the representatives of the young ones───instantly became delighted. Everyone's expression became brave.
<br><br>"If it became something like that, I won't lose, Rias-san!"
<br><br>Irina made a complete change and made a declaration like a rival.
<br><br>"Fumu, I won't lose to Gremory's too".
<br><br>""Yes, the same here"".
<br><br>Sairaorg-san, ex-Kaichou Sona and Seekvaira-san accepted this too. Vali too showed a profound smile. Seeing the faces of the representatives of the young ones filled with motivation, a certain thought ran through my mind...... Somehow, this situation, how should I put it? It feels like we are dancing on the palm of their hands...
<br><br>Kiba who was standing at my side said.
<br><br>"Aren't you guys being deceived by Sirzechs-sama and Azazel-sensei....?"
<br><br>Yes, I have the same opinion as Kiba. I think that the important people foresighted that if Rias and the people present here were to instigate each other, they would become motivated for the presentation contest......
<br><br>But I'm interested in this exhibition too. So let's raise our spirits as someone from the Gremory peerage!
<br><br>In this way, we started moving to the presentation in the free area.<br><br>

<h2>Part 2</h2>
Although the things displayed in the Pavilion can be chosen, firstly we need to choose the design of the building itself. Rias hurriedly ordered it from a pro-designer in the Underworld. Although the schedule was absurd, there seemed to be hope in accomplishing it.
<br><br>───In that case, the problem is what we are going to display inside. On the upstairs floor of Hyoudou residence; the VIP room, Rias put the specialties of the Gremory territory on the table.
<br><br>All members of the Gremory peerage were gathered here. Irina however, wasn’t here. Because she's an Angel, she probably dropped by the meeting on that side. This time, we're going to be rivals concerning the free area. We're shutting out the information before the fact from each other.
<br><br>Rias is looking forward to what the Angels and the young Devils are going to show.
<br><br>Then about the specialties; but this is my first time seeing the crops produced on the Gremory territory. There are industrial goods​, handicrafts, ornaments and various other goods. Awide variety of things I've never seen are gathered.
<br><br>Kiba said, while checking the list.
<br><br>"Then, Rias-buchou, is it alright that these specialties are the things that are going to be presented by the Gremory?"
<br><br>Rias nodded.
<br><br>"Yes. Basically, we'll introduce the crops and industrial goods​ produced in our territory as the core. We won't lose to any other High-class Devil territory when we are talking about crimson coloured handicrafts and ornaments as well as the Gremory history".
<br><br>"The history?"
<br><br>Asia tilted her head cutely and Rias nodded while smiling.
<br><br>"Yes, I heard that the founder of our Gremory family mounted a big camel while receiving requests concerning the past, present, and future by those who summoned him. Also, being good at hiding riches is one of the Gremory's characteristics too. My father is a specialist in this area. Moreover, everyone from the clan prides themselves at being stronger than anyone when the request is about love─── then I thought about making a simple promotional video about the history of my family to broadcast at the Pavilion. Distributing small pamphlets would also be a good form of advertisement too".
<br><br>The Gremory founder-sama───that is to say, he's a representative​-like person recorded down in the books connected with Devils. From what I learned from Rias' mother, the founder seemed to have displayed those abilities that Rias mentioned.
<br><br>......The founder-sama is still alive? It's often the case that the founders of the former 72 Pillars are just living in seclusion. I heard that Rias' grandfather and grandmother, and those from generations above them are living in the tip of Gremory's territory. Thinking about the founder-sama is good, but I felt some doubts and asked Rias.
<br><br>"......Although, our peerage grants every kind of request, is it Rias’ policy?"
<br><br>"That's right. To be honest, my father and his peerage are already categorised under the characteristics of my house. When I become the family head I'll have to deal with it whether I want to or not. That's why currently, I'm granting every kind of wish".
<br><br>Koneko-chan said.
<br><br>"......Ex-Kaichou Sona follows the same policy as Rias-buchou, right?"
<br><br>Rias nodded saying "Yes".
<br><br>"Frankly, I'm only imitating Sona. 'Knowing that you'll have to emulate​ the characteristics of the house when you inherit it, it's better to accumulate all kinds of experience while you are still free'───I feel the same. It's something wonderful to master something, but if it's something you can do, learn about various things so that no matter what kind of problem occurs, you'll have the experience accumulated to deal with it".
<br><br>Rias' father is currently in charge of inheriting the factor from the founder-sama───then Rias is currently dealing with various things.
<br><br>So, it was decided that Rias will display the specialities of the territory and the history of Gremory. Quite the fitting line-up. Looks like we'll be able to produce items to display in the exhibition.
<br><br>......However, why do I feel that this is a little lacking, as it seemed to not be enough? Is it because I experienced many things defying the accepted norms since I reincarnated? No, no, my experiences are categorised as weird even by the average Devil, so I shouldn't use myself as the standard.
<br><br>Gya-suke raised his hand timidly.
<br><br>"S-say, it's alright in not doing [Oppai Dragon]? For the time being, the House of Gremory controls the copyright, right?"
<br><br>That's right, I forgot about that! That is the most important speciality! As Gasper said, the copyright management of [Chichiryuutei Oppai Dragon] belongs to the House of Gremory, which I'm affiliated with. That meant that the Gremory territory equals [Oppai Dragon]. Rias gave a bitter smile.
<br><br>"Yes, that's right.......certainly, if it's about its popularity​ in the Underworld, then [Oppai Dragon] is probably more famous than the handicrafts produced in our territory. However; that's why we should introduce the proper specialties. Moreover, [Oppai Dragon] will be naturally introduced as a speciality of the Devils side, so it's alright even if we don't do it on purpose. Oh well......if we implement the Gremory Pavilion, we can do a light performance".
<br><br>I see. This would be naturally introduced in the Pavilion created by the Devils. Certainly, in this way, it's more effective. [This is really popular among the children of the Underworld!] Is this something that will be printed large-scale? ......It's better for me to show my face on the Pavilion of the Devils too? No, because they'll absolutely tell me to go there, it's better for me to prepare myself.
<br><br>We then estimated more or less everything that we planned to show at the presentation. The day in question then came, but...... The presentation in the free area became something that far surpassed our imagination in a distorted way.<br><br>

<h2>Part 3</h2>
The day of presentation───
<br><br>In an assembly hall in a certain place,​ the young representatives from every faction gathered. Looking at the surroundings, it wasn't only us, the young Devils. Of course, there're participants of the Angel side and Fallen Angel side too.
<br><br>The proscenium​ stage was turned into a publication place, as those making their presentation would show its contents above the stage. In the front seats of the stage were the higher-ups of every faction as judges. Of course, we would be learning about the other participants from the audience seats. Or rather, the audience seats were filled with people from all factions.
<br><br>"......It's full of people".
<br><br>Asia was overwhelmed by the crowd of participants in the assembly hall.
<br><br>...... It unexpectedly became a presentation with a high degree of attention. The seats were nearly fully occupied​. Even though it's a presentation concerning the remaining site, it attracted more interest​ than we had expected​.
<br><br>Well the impression I have is that the guests probably came to see this presentation because the atmosphere in the assembly hall was friendly and they thought it would be interesting. To tell the truth, I can feel the same from the judges......
<br><br>───While I was thinking that, if you were to look around carefully, you could see people who appear to be on guard​ in various places ​in the corners of the assembly hall. Rossweisse-san whispered in my ear.
<br><br>"...... It looks like there's a dangerous person inside the Norse faction who raises an objection about this exhibition, so even as a precaution, they deployed guards from every faction for the time being".
<br><br>Ah───so there's someone similar to Loki, who hated the Norse side joining forces with other mythological factions. When the moment comes, the members of [DxD] here gathered will have to confront​ them. We can only pray that it does not happen.
<br><br>We, from the Gremory peerage, didn't remain in the audience seats and moved to the waiting room exclusive to participants. We can see the presentation progressing on the stage through a monitor in the waiting room.
<br><br>We could hear cheering voices from the monitor. Looking at it, we could see the host standing on the stage giving the greeting of initiation​.
<br><br>"Well then, Asgard​ presents the start of the presentation tournament concerning the last space of this big exhibition!"
<br><br>In this way, the presentation tournament started.
<br><br>『Eh───for this reason, we made this motorised monocycle, which is fueled by demonic power』
<br><br>The presentation tournament progressed. Currently, it's the time of the sixteenth participant. Looks like he's a reincarnated Devil who rose to High-class. He's talking about an invention: Vehicles that move by using demonic power. Looks like this is the industry in the territory where this guy reincarnated, but......
<br><br>About the higher-ups who should be judging it..... On one side, there are those like Sirzechs-sama and Michael-sama; who are seriously listening to it, and on the other side, there's those resting their chin in their hands and those sleeping. Clearly those who looked bored started appearing.
<br><br>The latter were Azazel-sensei and Odin-jiisan… because that machine looks like something that sensei could create himself, so his interest is probably small​. In the case of Odin-jiisan, he probably isn't even interested in machines itself......
<br><br>Even if the assembly hall is excited, in fact, since the peak of applause at the beginning of the presentation, after that, the applause sounded businesslike. We too looked through the monitor of the waiting room, but there was nothing worth mentioning.
<br><br>At best, there were discussions like [I see, so the speciality of that territory is this kind of thing!] or [So that group of Fallen Angels were doing this kind of research.] and other similar discussions . So just like seeing a variety of TV programs, it would only pull a small amount of your interest.
<br><br>This meant that an interesting presentation surpassing our imaginations still didn't come out.
<br><br>"This is a good thing".
<br><br>Rias said this while nodding.
<br><br>Seeing it progressing peacefully, she was the happiest with this kind of presentation tournament. This time, the one who was going to stand on the stage was Rias.
<br><br>For the time being, her supporters were going to be Akeno-san and Kiba (who would be operating a huge video monitor which is already planted above the stage).
<br><br>But it's basically planned that the one who’ll make the presentation in the presence of the public will be only Rias.
<br><br>Last night, with us as the audience, Rias' rehearsal​ presentation ended without a hitch. As long as something unexpected doesn't happen, it'll end without trouble.
<br><br>Through the presentation, Rias was calm, with an atmosphere saying "Come at me whenever you want" while waiting for her turn. Then, the host announced the next participant to make his presentation───
<br><br>『Next, it's the presentation of the reincarnated Angels!』
<br><br>What! Next it's the Angel faction!
<br><br>The one standing on the stage was───Irina! Somehow, her cheeks were red and she looked embarrassed. Well, I thought that Irina was the type that would finish this kind of thing flawlessly.
<br><br>But as expected, she's embarrassed because the higher-ups were the judges?
Taking the microphone in her hands, Irina started her presentation under the attentive​ gaze of Michael-san.
<br><br>"W-well, what we reincarnated Angels are going to present...... is this doorknob!"
<br><br>What she took out was───a single doorknob! I-I'm familiar with this doorknob! Or rather, everyone who lives in the Hyoudou residence knows it! It's a doorknob that takes one through to a room where Angels won't fall even if they do something lewd with someone from another race! Irina, while wiggling her body, said.
<br><br>"Th-this..... I-if you install this in any door..... You can go to a certain room. I-in that room...... it's alright for an Angel and a member of another race to have a sexual relationship!"
<br><br>Irina declared with a bright red face and the assembly hall became excited.
<br><br>"I-I received a prototype model, so I tested it many times".
<br><br>With Irina's embarrassed voice, we could hear the excited cheering voice of the men in the assembly hall. Or rather, the reincarnated angels are going to show the invention of the Ero Room!? This is terrible! Heaven is going to be painted pink!
<br><br>─── Odin-jiisan, who should be sleeping, woke up with large-bright eyes, and asked Irina with a lewd expression.
<br><br>"Is it alright for me to ask something?"
<br><br>"Y-yes".
<br><br>Being asked by the Chief Norse God who was a judge, Irina was showing a nervous appearance. Without caring, Odin-jiisan asked with a lewd face.
<br><br>"Young angel girl, when was the first time you used this room?"
<br><br>"......W-well, the end of the year".
<br><br>"And who did you use it with?"
<br><br>".....M-my male childhood friend!"
<br><br>"And what kind of thing did you do there?"
<br><br>"......H-he touched my breasts......"
<br><br>"Your breasts? In what way?"
<br><br>"......I-I said it was alright for him to touch..... Because if it was him, it was alright......"
<br><br>"When you were touched, how did you feel?"
<br><br>"......I-I didn't dislike it...... o-r, or rather......... AAaaaah, I'm going to fall! If I were to answer something lewd like this before doing it with Ise-kun...... Ah, it's different! I, it's not like that! This is a presentation! Aaaahh! I'm going to fall!"
<br><br>Hearing the insistent sexual harassment​ talk from Odin-jiisan, Irina was at her wits' end, as her wings started flashing in black and white! That jii-san! To wake up at this kind of time!
<br><br>Above all, to sexually harass Irina! What a lewd jii-san! But I became a little excited! Chief Norse God-sama, thank you! Or rather, Michael-san in the judge's seat somehow looked satisfied!? There's something to feel satisfied at Irina's embarrassing appearance!?
<br><br>"That jii-san! I can't endure it anymore!"
<br><br>The patience of Rossweisse-san, who was looking through the monitor, went past its limits. As if invading the stage, she flew out of the waiting room! Before long, through Rossweisse-san's mediation,​ the sexual harassment of Odin-jiisan stopped and the presentation of the reincarnated Angels ended safely.
<br><br>After several​ groups made their presentation, once again the presentation of someone we knew, started.
<br><br>『Then, I'll move to the next presentation. The next person, please come up on the stage.』
<br><br>With the host’s urging, the one who stood on the stage was───Vali with a towel coiled around his head!? He was with a black t-shirt and an apron on his waist. Vali took the microphone and said fearlessly.
<br><br>"I'm Vali Lucifer, the one who became the adopted son of Chief God Odin. I'm standing in this presentation today as Odin’s adopted son".
<br><br>Even though he's standing in this place with many important people from the Norse side, he didn’t change this bold attitude! If you're criticised later, don't complain...... well, the mentioned adopted father was watching attentively with a smile as to what the adopted son-sama was going to serve is───
<br><br>Young men and women with towels coiled around their heads, set a vessel───porcelain bowl with food at the seat of the judges...... Looking well at them, it was Bikou, Kuroka, Arthur and Le Fay! When I thought that we didn't see Kuroka and Le Fay this morning, they were recruited to help out with this!? Furthermore​, the black t-shirts they're wearing have [Hakuryuukou] written on them in white letters!
<br><br>The camera showed the food that was inside the porcelain bowl───It was ramen, which was raising white vapour. Vali took the microphone and started explaining.
<br><br>『What we are going to display and introduce at the Pavilion is ramen. However; it's not normal ramen. It's cooked up by the ingredients we found in the Human World, Underworld, and other locations.​ We offer to you a bowl of supreme ramen. I want you to start it by drinking the soup.』
<br><br>Vali urged the judges like that....... There are many places I want to tsukkomi; but first, let's see the situation.
<br><br>"There's no renge [1] ?"
<br><br>Azazel-sensei was searching for the ceramic spoon. He probably wants to scoop the soup with a spoon; however, Vali shook his head.
<br><br>"Renge is the main cause which makes the soup colder. I'm sorry, but drink it in the normal way".
<br><br>This guy Vali somehow, is showing an extreme fixation. The judges drank the soup from the bowl. After all of them put it in their mouths, Vali started explaining.
<br><br>『The soup was made by cooking the chicken bones of the cockatrice who lives in the old territory of the now-extinct Andras Family. And the bones of the pig of the Underworld who lives in the old territory of the now-extinct Zagan family, with Northern Europe vegetables as the core. We made every kind of seafood by using the fish we fished and dried from the lakes of Underworld. The noodles​ too were made by hand. The ingredients are───』
<br><br>─── Vali then gave a long explanation about the ingredients, as he even started explaining how to make it. The judges, who were receiving the explanation were silently drinking the soup, but......
<br><br>This guy; Vali... When I thought that he was wandering through every part of the world searching for strong opponents, he was searching for ingredients for ramen at the same time too........ Unexpectedly, maybe this was his true intention........?
<br><br>The judges who ate to some extent began to raise their voices. The first was Odin-jiisan.
<br><br>"Well, I don't like food with greasy seasoning very much. Besides, the taste is so complicated and mysterious that I don't understand it very well. When I went to Japan, Azazel took me to ramen at a food cart. I think that one was tastier than this".
<br><br>Suddenly, his adopted father started criticising his food! Moreover, his ramen was rated lower than those found on food carts! Well, anyway, it's ramen eaten after being drunk or enjoying yourself in the oppai pub, right!? Even though you don't even remember the taste of it!
<br><br>However, Odin-jiisan wasn't the only one who gave this kind of judgement! After eating half of it, Michael-sama wiped his mouth with a handkerchief​.
<br><br>"It's the first time I eat something called ramen, but I like my soup with a mild flavour, you see? However, there's probably some who like this kind of flavour in the Nordic countries".
<br><br>Even while criticising, Michael-san doesn't forget to encourage it. Truly the words of the leader of the Angels!
<br><br>"I have the same opinion as Michael-sama".
<br><br>Sirzechs-sama gave the same kind of evaluation. Coming until here, Azazel-sensei made a request to Vali.
<br><br>"As expected, give me a spoon, Vali. I like to eat small pieces of ramen in the spoon. Flavour? Well, I can't say I'm surprised".
<br><br>Before the taste, another request came flying! Furthermore, he gave an unspeakable evaluation to his student!
<br><br>"...............!!"
<br><br>The person in question; Vali, couldn't hide his shock as his mouth was hanging half open. It looks like he had confidence in his ramen’s flavour....... but the ramen’s flavour focused heavily on the person’s own taste. Moreover, the judges came from different countries and due to that, the personal taste for everyone becomes even more divided.
<br><br>On the camera, the images of the laughing Bikou and Kuroka were shown...... those guys, seeing that appearance of Vali, it did really hit them in the right spot. Well, it's not every day that you see the Hakuryuukou making ramen and being shocked at the evaluation it received.
<br><br>Vali ramen’s presentation had a miserable result. Seeing Vali suffering this kind of defeat is precious. This happened later, but I had the chance to eat the ramen that Vali made for the presentation. It was to my liking, Vali.
<br><br>The reincarnated Angels introducing the Ero Room, and the current Hakuryuukou being battered by the evaluation he received for his ramen was nothing more than a scene in a play. After that, nothing particular happened and the presentation progressed indifferently.
<br><br>However, this stability didn't continue for long───While Rias' turn was approaching, this happened.
<br><br>『Next it's the presentation of Bael household』
<br><br>The host person read the name of the next participant.
<br><br>Ooh! It's Sairaorg-san's time! This is going to be fun! What is he going to show? As expected, some speciality? If I'm not wrong, apples are the speciality of Bael territory. Maybe he'll do some propaganda about Apples?
<br><br>───Then......
<br><br>"It's terrible!"
<br><br>Rossweisse-san who had gone outside to see the situation came back out of breath​.
<br><br>"What happened?"
<br><br>Rias looked puzzled seeing Rossweisse-san’s state. Rossweisse-san said while regaining her breath.
<br><br>"I-in fact! I heard that the presentation of Bael's side today will be a fight between Bapple-kun vs Blaze Meteor Dragon, Tannin-sama!"
<br><br>『Eeehh!!?』
<br><br>Everyone became surprised by hearing this information! Of course! Why did Bael's presentation become something like a pro wrestling fight!!?
<br><br>By the way, [Bapple-kun] is a costumed mascot character who imitates an apple which is the local speciality of the Bael territory. The person inside it is mainly Sairaorg-san......
<br><br>By any chance, could the fight between Sairaorg-san vs Tannin-ossan become the fight of the century? Particularly that's terribly interesting, but what about the exhibition!?
<br><br>Meanwhile, the image in the camera changed to a completely different one. It was a different place, a vast land with ruins───the camera focused on its centre, where a square-shaped apple was reflected! Above the apple───was a muscular warrior in the costume of a mascot character with the head of an apple!
<br><br>With this sudden happening, we could hear the noise that people were making in the assembly hall through the monitor. The camera ran through the seat of the judges too.
<br><br>Azazel-sensei and Odin-jiisan have bent themselves forward and looked really intrigued about it. The muscular mascot character with an apple head shouted from above the apple.
<br><br>『My name is [Bapple], a mascot character of Bael territory! Today, upon hearing about the contest concerning this exhibition’s free area of, I thought about participating so I rushed to this place! First, I want to apologise for not being in the same place as all of you.』
<br><br>This voice, it's Sairaorg-san, AAaahh! Moreover, an apple! Th-then, what Rossweisse-san previously said was the truth───
<br><br>To us who could only become surprised, the camera showed the sky. There a giant floating shadow was reflected! That's right, It was the former-Dragon King, Tannin-ossan!
<br><br>Tannin-ossan descended above the square apple while causing an earth tremor​. Bapple-kun...... Sairaorg-san and Tannin-ossan were facing each other! By only standing in it, that huge ossan made the square apple look small. Bapple-kun shouted.
<br><br>『The specialty of the Bael territory is apples!! And this [Bapple-kun] is a mascot character who imitates it! There's nothing better than being able to appeal to both of them at the same time! To sum up, what I want to say is, simple things are the best! That's right, I only have to show the power of [Bapple-kun]!』
<br><br>When he said something like this before a Dragon───somehow, the assembly hall with the judges entered an extremely excited state!
<br><br>The cheering voices trembled the atmosphere and even reached the waiting room. To think that he would have a match with the former Dragon King-ossan to appeal to Bapple-kun......
<br><br>Certainly, there's nothing better than this to present Bapple-kun and the apples from Bael territory...... but it makes one think that it wasn't Sairaorg-san’s idea.
<br><br>But, Tannin-ossan is really devoted. Even though he probably doesn't want to participate in this kind of event..... Ah, well, but he would probably join if it's for the well being of the young ones. Somehow, he is a good person, no, no, this master of mine is a good Dragon. I was nodding my head, but Koneko-chan said.
<br><br>"......This Tannin-sama is a little, weird".
<br><br>Everyone heard this and looked at Tannin-ossan shown on the monitor with doubt. There's no change worth mentioning, but...... His eyes looked a little emotionless. If I were near, maybe I could feel the change in the nature of his aura, but... through the monitor is hard. But, Koneko-chan's senses proved to be right.
<br><br>Suddenly, Tannin-ossan on the monitor started releasing an immense amount of light from all over his body! After releasing enough light to make one dizzy, a change occurred in Tannin-ossan's body! The scales of his body started to peel off and fall, and under that, a skin of steel appeared!? What appeared on the monitor was, a mechanical-looking Tannin-ossan! Or rather, is this a robot!!?
<br><br>When not only we, in the waiting room, but everyone in the assembly hall became surprised, that voice echoed.
<br><br>『Fufufu! Everyone, did you see it? I'm the next family head of the Agares household and my name is Seekvaira Agares』
<br><br>The one who suddenly fell above the stage was Seekvaira-san! After adjusting her glasses, she continued.
<br><br>『This Tannin-sama was created with the cooperation of the real one and the miracle-like mechanism of our Agares household! The Dragon model; Weapon of Decisive Battle───Mecha-Tannin!』
<br><br>───Mecha-Tannin!
<br><br>Wh-what the hell is that, AAAaaah!!! That is a robot made at Seekvaria-san's place!!!??
<br><br>Seekvaira-san is a woman who loves Japanese robot anime above everything. Those feelings grew so much that she even started asking Azazel-sensei to manufacture it for her, She even started her own research on it, this crazy...... No, this passionate Princess-sama! The robot-otaku, Seekvaira-san, Said to the judges and the audience.
<br><br>『Tonight, this battle is about the pride of the Bael household, the mascot character, [Bapple-kun] against the crystallisation of the technical prowess of our Agares household, our pride, [Mecha Tannin]! A dream-like matching​! This could even be said to be a proxy war between the Great King Bael and the Archduke Agares! Now, who is going to win? everyone, let's watch it!』
<br><br>[[[[[[[[OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHH!!!!!!!]]]]]]]]
<br><br>The assembly hall became extremely excited! At the same time, the battle between [Bapple-kun], who was clad in Touki and Mecha-Tannin, who was shooting flames from his mouth, began!
<br><br>Azazel-sensei and Odin-jiisan were saying: "Go, go, shoot him down!" and "Ho, ho, ho, this looks interesting". They were in high spirits! The assembly hall was excited like never before!
<br><br>So, there's this way of making a presentation too!? Through this match, they can make propaganda for Bael's apples and Bapple-kun, as well as the Agares’ machine industry! With this extremely unexpected turn of events, we could only be overwhelmed by it!
<br><br>I don't know what to think about it as a presentation; however, seeing this result in a certain meaning, it could be said that this is the most suitable way to show what Sairaorg-san and Seekvaira-san brought!
<br><br>I mean, the judges of this presentation are, Azazel-sensei, Sirzechs-sama and Odin-jiisan who are the types of people who would be happy about this kind of pro-wrestling-like match!
<br><br>......Sairaorg-san and Seekvaira-san perceived and used it? No, this isn't the kind of thing that those two serious persons would do in this kind of event. I couldn't help but feel that something was wrong.
<br><br>"...... Looks like someone gave advice to Sairaorg and Seekvaira".
<br><br>It was Rias, who couldn't hide the confused colour in her face looking at her cousin's presentation.
<br><br>"......They beat us, Rias".
<br><br>The one who appeared while sighing was ex-Kaichou Sona. Ex-Kaichou continued.
<br><br>"......Probably, someone in the vicinity of Azazel-sensei told something to Sairaorg or Seekvaria. In this way, we who will make our presentations later will be at a disadvantage. If we don't show something surpassing that, we won’t be able to win".
<br><br>It's as ex-Kaichou said. Now that the assembly hall was excited until this point, if the contents of our presentation which may come right after them don't surpass this, we have no chance of winning!
<br><br>But what we are going to show is what we rehearsed the other day───It's only about the Gremory history and the Gremory territory specialties! After that presentation... no matter how you look at it, it pales in comparison.
<br><br>"......Certainly, they beat us. Now that they have done something with this impact, as long as it isn't something that surpasses it, every presentation that comes after will just look plain".
<br><br>That's right! Ah───why sensei and the others didn't give us advice but gave it to Sairaorg-san and his group......?
<br><br>Kiba perceived what I was thinking? He said.
<br><br>"......Sensei probably didn't give us advice because he knew we definitely wouldn't do this kind of thing. On the contrary, he gave advice to Sairaorg Bael-san and Seekvaira Agares-san, who would probably seriously think about it".
<br><br>It's as Kiba said. If sensei came with this kind of advice to us, we would only ignore it while saying "Yes, yes". Because he always talks about this kind of thing, we would end up ignoring it too. It probably would have the same result with ex-Kaichou Sona too.
<br><br>However, Sairaorg-san and Seekvaira-san aren't familiar with Azazel-sensei like we are, so I think that they received his advice overly seriously.
<br><br>And Tannin-ossan is a good Dragon at socialising, so he probably cooperated in creating his mecha-version......
<br><br>And the result is this situation. Rias asked ex-Kaichou Sona.
<br><br>"......Sona, are you going to present the specialities of your territory?"
<br><br>Ex-Kaichou said, shrugging her shoulders​.
<br><br>"......Yes, I will make propaganda about nature surrounding the Sitri territory and explain the fullness of our medical institution​s. You’re basically doing the same thing too, right Rias? In this way, neither of us has a chance of winning".
<br><br>So the Sitri side will do something similar to us..... Then, it looks like we can't beat the ongoing presentation......
<br><br>"D-do it here!"
<br><br>"......That mecha was sent flying with a punch!"
<br><br>"Hmm, as expected, with a mecha as the opponent, Touki doesn't work very well!"
<br><br>Gya-suke, Koneko-chan and Xenovia were clinging to the monitor!
<br><br>Because uneventful presentations that continued until now, this mascot character vs Mecha-Dragon presentation became more interesting than imagined for those watching!
<br><br>The [Bapple-kun] vs Mecha-Dragon fight presentation was heated from the beginning until the end, as both the audience and judges erupted in applauses───
<br><br>"......Well, this is the critical moment​".
<br><br>Rias’ tone of voice was a little lower than normal.
<br><br>In the end, the joint presentation (Pro-wrestling show) of Bael household and Agares household ended receiving favourable reception from both the audience and the judges. Did it have a script? The match ended in a draw. It was a lovely production that even took into consideration the dignity of both families​.
<br><br>───And then came the time for us, the Gremory peerage, to make our presentation. After that previous presentation, the impact of every other presentation was light, as no one would be able to surpass that.
<br><br>As a matter of fact, everyone in this assembly hall probably thought that the winners were the Bael household and the Agares household.
<br><br>"In any case, we'll do our best. After all, our citizens poured their heart and soul into​ making these".
<br><br>Hmm, I wanted the population of the Gremory territory to hear those words! Even if it's a battle that she's very likely to lose, your Princess-sama is thinking of doing her best for her people!
<br><br>We will do our best to support Rias───Our master!
<br><br>Everyone felt the same even without saying anything? We then exchanged looks and nodded. Leaving the waiting room, we walked towards the stage!
<br><br>───When we left the room, we could hear noise from the direction of the assembly hall. We became curious too, so we rushed towards the assembly hall───
<br><br>"I have an objection against this presentation!"
<br><br>We could hear the courageous voice of a woman.
<br><br>A young woman stood alone above the stage. She was a beauty with a tall figure with long hair of mixed colours of red and blue, dressed in a robe with white and black colours as the basic tone. Her sharp almond eyes captured the judges.
<br><br>From the quality of the aura clad in her body, we could know that she wasn't an ordinary person. One of the judges; Odin-jiisan, sighed in lament after seeing the woman.
<br><br>"......So it's you, Hel. Why did you come flying? Do you plan to participate too?"
<br><br>Hearing Jii-san’s fed-up voice , the woman called Hel looked furious.
<br><br>"Chief God Odin! Release my father; Loki and my older brother Fenrir immediately! If you do so, I'll withdraw my objection against this presentation!"
<br><br>───! I was shocked at the woman's words! 'My father Loki'! Then she's the daughter of that Evil God?
<br><br>......Furthermore, Fenrir’s sister? Hmm, so the wolf and the beauty are siblings... somehow, I can't connect those two inside my mind, but the opponent has a godly lineage , so there's probably various circumstances.
<br><br>The mentioned Onii-chan, Fenrir, is in the corner of the assembly hall looking disinterested while yawning...... The legendary monster-sama who had a battle to the death with us, doesn't have dignity.....
<br><br>Hel started releasing a dangerous aura from her body, as the guards strengthened their vigilance. The way she spoke, the atmosphere and pressure of her aura, reminded me of Loki.
<br><br>Well, I can't feel a level of power similar to Loki, but she's probably an opponent you can't let your guard down around. She probably has the power to blow up this assembly hall in one shot.
<br><br>Though there's no way she can defeat Odin-jiisan and the other higher-ups. But even so, she came to this place, so she probably thought of a way to destroy this presentation at least.
<br><br>She declared her objection with the determination of dying without surrendering​. She's probably one of those who didn’t look well upon this event that I've heard before. Seeing this, Azazel-sensei took a deep breath.
<br><br>"These days, this kind of thing is not popular, you know? Your father did the same thing and was thrown in jail. Well, why don't you calm down and we can be judges together?"
<br><br>However, this persuasion (which can't be thought of as one) was in vain as it only raised Hel’s anger and aura.
<br><br>"I understand. If it has come to this, then at least I’ll destroy this assembly hall!"
<br><br>She put her hand forward and let magical power overflow from it! Oi, oi, oi! You are seriously going to release magic in this place!? We took a defensive stance!
<br><br>Azazel-sensei took the microphone and said to me. Did he perceive I was here?
<br><br>"Ise! Defeat her with your technique!"
<br><br>Now you said it, Sensei! Good grief​! This kind of troublesome thing is always pushed at [DxD], or rather, pushed at me!
<br><br>I swiftly activated Balance Breaker and jumped forward! Hel perceived my existence as I was approaching, but......
<br><br>"You are the Sekiryuutei who defeated my father! This is a good opportunity! I'll avenge my father!"
<br><br>She bravely changed the direction of her hand towards me! She was fully motivated​ to do it! However! If the opponent is a woman───I'm invincible!
<br><br>I concentrated demonic power in my head and released the image inside my brain in this place! A pink coloured space made of demonic power was spread above the stage.
<br><br>『Pailingual!』
<br><br>My technique which was released covered Hel and exposed what was inside her chest!
<br><br>【To be honest​, there's magic explosive seals engraved in my body that I voluntarily engraved. The instant that someone touches me, this whole place will be blown to pieces.】
<br><br>Her oppai told me inside my mind! Like always, it talked with a tone of voice completely different from the person herself! I shouted at Rossweisse-san, who was waiting in the rearguard!
<br><br>"Rossweisse-san! Looks like this person has magic explosive seals engraved in her body!"
<br><br>Rossweisse-san instantly spread a dispelling magic circle on her hand. The magic words and numbers engraved on the magic circle started to move fiercely! At the same time, from Hel's body, pale light was released.
<br><br>With Rossweisse’s dispelling magic, the seals in Hel's body probably disappeared.
<br><br>"D-damn you!"
<br><br>Hel was confused at the changes in her body, but my attack will start from here! I closed our distances in one go and touched her shoulder!
<br><br>In that instant, the conditions to activate that technique were met! I took a cool pose while raising my aura! And then, shouted the name of the technique!
<br><br>【Dress Break!】
<br><br>The clothes that Hel was dressed in splendidly collapsed in a instant and she returned to the appearance of when she was born.
<br><br>"......W-what is this technique!?"
<br><br>After becoming surprised at the result of the technique, Hel finally covered her important parts! She had a white skin and voluptuous limbs that couldn't be thought of from that robe, unconsciously I stored her appearance in my brain! The men in the assembly hall [Oohhh!!] raised excited voices!
<br><br>"Now, Rossweisse! Capture her!"
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>Following Rias’ instructions, Rossweisse-san released her binding magic. Hel, who became fully naked, was strongly bound by the ropes made of light created by Rossweisse-san. Hel was swiftly moved from here through a transportation magic circle by the bodyguards who gathered after being captured.
<br><br>Fuu, when Azazel-sensei suddenly brought up the topic, I was worried about what could happen, but unexpectedly, if we try we can do it...... It's a good thing that the opponent was a woman.
<br><br>Clap, clap. Applauses were raised by the audience seat. Gradually , the applauses grew louder───
<br><br>Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap.
<br><br>A wave of applause filled the assembly hall. Everything was aimed at us───no, it was aimed at me!?
<br><br>Hah?
<br><br>Ah───they probably are applauding me because I was able to deal with Hel, who attacked the assembly hall. The judges and the audience, everyone gave me a standing ovation. Azazel-sensei took the microphone and said.
<br><br>『Did all you see it? Ladies and gentlemen, this too is one of the specialities of Gremory; the [Oppai Dragon]! And now, what you have just witnessed is one of [Oppai Dragon]’s techniques : [Dress Break] and [Pailingual]! Both of them were developed by the [Oppai Dragon], as they are terribly interesting techniques. Let's give him and his comrades one more wave of applauses for making splendid use of this technique!』
<br><br>With Sensei’s words, an immense wave of applause occurred once again! I-it’s not like this thing was our presentation, you know!?
<br><br>Good grief! Sensei linked these events as something from our presentation! In conclusion, after this uproar ended, Rias made the presentation about the specialities of Gremory territory, but...... from the audience something like [Oppai Dragon is the best!] could be heard. Thus the presentation tournament concerning the young members of every faction continued until the end.<br><br>

<h2>Part 4</h2>
Days later───
<br><br>To us, who were waiting for the result of the presentation just a little​, the information came.
<br><br>The results were, the theme​ of [The young ones of every faction] can be founded. That means that It was decided that the contents shown by the young ones of every faction───the anti-Terrorist team [DxD] and others will be put together in a combined Pavilion.
<br><br>If it's something displayed by the young ones, it's okay. The specialities of every territory too can be shown there. The efforts of Rias and ex-Kaichou Sona didn't end in vain. The reason for this decision was this: [The differences​ shown in the presentation stood out​], looks like they did it like this because we are young...... It makes one doubt if this result wasn't set from the beginning.
<br><br>Even though it was already decided, the presentation tournament opened for the enjoyment of Azazel-sensei and the others. Looking at that appearance of Azazel-sensei and the others enjoying themselves makes me think that my conjecture is right...... In fact, having perceived it is not really bothering me. What is bothering me is───
<br><br>"Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!??? To give a lecture about Dress Break and Pailingual in the Pavilion!!?"
<br><br>Hering this information from sensei, my eyes jumped out of my face from surprise!
Sensei said.
<br><br>"Yes, that chain of events of you guys capturing Hel───To sum it up,, the audience seems to have been shocked by Dress Break and Pailingual. I mean, Loki’s daughter was defeated one-sidedly without being able to do anything. So of course it would become a topic. Moreover, the Norse faction is enthusiastic about their research regarding magic. Everyone became interested in your Ero-technique. In a certain way, it'll become a special display item for them".
<br><br>......How could this happen! My Ero-technique piqued the interest of the Norse factions gentlemen! Sensei put his hand on my shoulder and said.
<br><br>"On the appointed day, you will participate actively together with Ero room, [Bapple-kun] and Mecha-Tannin".
<br><br>It's not a reunion of interesting personnel! Koneko-chan murmured a few words in this situation.
<br><br>"......So, Ise-senpai is one of the interesting items that will be displayed".
<br><br>......Yes, looks like it. Anyhow, I'm the amusing [Oppai Dragon]! I don't care what will happen after this!
