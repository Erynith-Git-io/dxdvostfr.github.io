<h1 style="color: red; text-align: center">Fantasia Heroine Calendar Book 2018</h1><br><br>

<b>This was a conversation which began just a while after I became a third-year student. It was the New Year — we were all having a leisurely day at home. I was completely captivated by the program which was currently being broadcast on the television, so much so that it felt as though the television was drawing me in. —It was a car commercial. I was already old enough to get my driving license. Among the girls who lived at my house, Rias, Akeno-san and Rossweisse-san had already gotten their licenses. There was also Xenovia who had a motorcycle license. I kept wondering about what kind of car to buy if I was going to get one, and I even began to read car magazines both at school and at home as I dwelled on the issue.
<br><br>“If you’re that interested, do you want to take a look at the cars in the Underworld?”
<br><br>Rias suggested. So the next day, I immediately went to the Gremory territory — there were numerous cars lined up on the castle grounds! There were all kinds of vehicles which ranged from ordinary cars to sports cars. Rias’ father mentioned that he had prepared the cars for me. He then cheerfully said
<br><br>“When I heard that Ise-kun was interested in cars, I prepared various kinds of vehicles from the Underworld. Come over, choose your favourite one. It’s fine even if you want to have all of them. Let’s just call it a New Year’s gift.”
<br><br>How did this suddenly turn into a gift for me!? I just wanted to take a look! Rias placed her hand against her forehead as she said to her father
<br><br>“…Father, Ise just wanted to take a look at what kinds of cars there were.”
<br><br>Rias’ father simply nodded.
<br><br>“Well, let me introduce them.”
<br><br>The first one that he introduced was a crimson sports car. Its streamlined body was exquisite. Rias’ father said
<br><br>“This is a sports car which uses demonic energy to run, and can reach up to three hundred and twenty kilometres per hour. Fufufu, it’s as fast as the Shinkansen, and the exterior is also made from mythril silver, so it’s pretty tough.”
<br><br>He started off the introductions with a ridiculous one!? It was capable of the same speed as the Shinkansen, and it was also made from a legendary metal! If it’s something like that, it’d take a while to get used to, and I can’t use it in Japan…? Rias buried her face in her palm.
<br><br>“…Father, please be a bit more mindful. Ise’s main area of residence is Japan.”
<br><br>“I see. I unintentionally went with the standards of the Underworld.”
<br><br>…No, aren’t these specifications overkill even for the Underworld?
<br><br>The next one that he introduced was — an ordinary crimson sedan. Even if such a thing was in the human world, its appearance didn’t particularly make it stand out. Rias’ father knocked against the body of the car as he said
<br><br>“Its appearance is incredibly ordinary. But!”
<br><br>Rias’ father sent his demonic energy into it, and the ordinary-looking car made various noises as it gradually transformed! —What stood there was a metal giant which had transformed from the car! It transformed just like a robot! Although I was slightly excited by it, what was it!? Rias’ father proudly said
<br><br>“This is an iron golem! It can operate as a car, and also in this giant form! It’ll be a reassuring ally to have by your side in case of an emergency! Since the power comes from the golem itself moving, it’s very environment friendly!”
<br><br>Its true identity was an iron golem car! I’m sure Seekvaira-san would shed tears of happiness if she saw that…no, she might already have one….
<br><br>“……”
<br><br>Rias didn’t say anything, and simply raised her eyebrows. Seeing his daughter’s visible displeasure, Rias’ father coughed a few times as he cleared his throat. He avoided further explanation.
<br><br>Afterwards, we looked at all of the cars which had been prepared…there was a ghost car which was possessed by a guardian spirit, and also a super-gigantic car that could fit all of the members of team [DxD] inside it. While I was surprised by such things, I began to feel exhausted at the same time. Since Rias being angry at the situation was not helpful at all, all I could do was laugh….
<br><br>A crimson sports car which sat in a corner suddenly caught my eye. It had a simple design, but it also seemed elegant and calm. Somehow, it made me think that it was a special car. Both Rias and her father noticed my gaze, and they became nostalgic as they looked at the sports car.
<br><br>“It’s Sirzechs’ car.”
<br><br>“When onii-sama came home during his time off, he would take Millicas out to enjoy a short, one-hour drive.”
<br><br>…I see, so that’s Sirzechs-sama’s car…. I said to those two
<br><br>“…I’d prefer a car like that.”
<br><br>The sports car that Sirzechs-sama likes…isn’t that fine? When I get my license, I’d want to drive a car like that. Upon hearing me say that, Rias’ father smiled as he said
<br><br>“When the time comes, I’ll prepare the same model for you.”
<br><br>Rias’ father nodded as he continued
<br><br>“By the way—”
<br><br>Rias’ father held something in his hand that seemed like a remote control, and he pressed a switch. And then — Sirzechs-sama’s favourite car began to make metallic sounds as parts of it moved, and numerous missile launchers, machine guns and other kinds of weaponry popped out of the car’s body!
<br><br>“Those are the modifications that were made by former Governor Azazel. With that equipment, you’ll be fine even if there’s a terrorist attack. Hahaha, you can even go out to space with it!”
<br><br>Rias’ father heartily laughed as he said that. It’s not a decent car after all! My future car is still far away—.
