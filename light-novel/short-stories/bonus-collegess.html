<h1 style="color: red; text-align: center">College SS</h1><br><br>
<b>This incident took place after I had been promoted to a High-class Devil, and everyone had gotten used to their new lives.
<br><br>In Hyoudou Residence...
<br><br>Rias and Akeno-san were having a talk whilst spreading a pamphlet in the living room.
<br><br>"What's up, you two?"
<br><br>I initiated a conversation and Rias responded to my question.
<br><br>"Ah, we were discussing about which club we would be joining in college, now that we've familiarised ourselves with the environment."
<br><br>A club, is it? I mean, they were college students, so it was only natural to become interested in joining a club. In high school, it was the Occult Research Club, so I too became interested in what kind of club they would be joining in college.
<br><br>I asked as I looked at the pamphlet.
<br><br>"Are you thinking of joining a cultural club, like in high school, or a sports club? Or rather, it would be bad if you girls were to stand out in sports?"
<br><br>Because their physical abilities were much higher than normal humans, I guessed it would be hard to enter a sports club. Well, they just need to hide it, but.....to hide it every time would be troublesome.
<br><br>Looking at the pamphlet, my eyes stopped moving at the one marked with a pen.
<br><br>─Occult Research Society!
<br><br>There's one in the college too!? Oh, it's a [Society], not a [Club]. Oh, this feels so club-like!
<br><br>"This one......it's not related to us, right?"
<br><br>Rias giggled at my question.
<br><br>"Of course, it's not related. The Occult Club in high school was revived by us, so it's different from the one in the college."
<br><br>I know, right? This means that this is a normal occult club, with normal people as their members.
<br><br>Akeno-san said cheerfully.
<br><br>"Ufufu, for the time being, I was talking to Rias about going on a tour at this Occult Research Society. I heard there are only women who enjoy the occult as club members."
<br><br>I see, as expected, both of them had become curious about it. Or rather, a women-only club who loves occult definitely seemed amazing......
<br><br>On the following day ─ I was summoned in my armoured form, to a dark room with a magic circle drawn on the floor. In front of my eyes, was a group of women who had summoned me. Up in front, there was a beautiful onee-san with straight black hair and glasses and......Rias and Akeno-san!!
<br><br>Does that mean......that this was the Occult Research Society that Rias and Akeno-san would be attending to in college?
<br><br>Seeing me in my armoured form, the beautiful onee-san with straight black hair was shocked, but......Rias and Akeno-san gave only bitter smiles.
<br><br>In this situation where nothing could have been said, I asked the client, the onee-san with straight black hair.
<br><br>".........Hello? Are you are the one who called me?"
<br><br>Hearing me say this, the onee-san with straight black hair looked at Rias and the others’ direction and said with shining eyes.
<br><br>"See, it's like I said! The paper I picked up in front of the station,​ can really summon Devils!"
<br><br>Hearing those words, several female students who were surrounding us, turned their respect-filled gazes to the onee-san with straight black hair.
<br><br>[You did it, President!!]
<br><br>Rias approached me, who was racking my brain trying to understand the situation, and whispered in my ear.
<br><br>(......This is the college Occult Research Society.)
<br><br>(Ah, as expected.)
<br><br>(......Seems like the President, picked up a pamphlet that you guys scattered yesterday at work...... Besides, she was doing her personal research on how to summon Devils, resulting in this situation.)
<br><br>Ah ─ she summoned a Devil using one of the pamphlets scattered by my peerage. And thus, I ended up being summoned.
<br><br>Lately, I've been responding to my summons either in my human form or in armour depending upon my mood. This time too, I wore my armour because I felt like it.
<br><br>It was a custom to grant the request of a summoner after being summoned and with Rias, my master, watching me, I couldn't go back without fulfilling the request.
<br><br>Clearing my throat, I intentionally asked the onee-san with straight black hair, in a scary voice.
<br><br>"Ah ─ thee, who hath summoned me, speaketh thy wish."
<br><br>[Puhh!!]
<br><br>Rias and her group nearly laughed as I said that. P-please don't laugh, I'm being dead serious!!
<br><br>Suddenly the President of the Occult Research Society started blushing and asked bashfully.
<br><br>"T-then, I'll make my wish."
<br><br>She shouted as if she had made up her mind.
<br><br>"B-be my boyfriend! I want a Devil boyfriend!! Please make a contract with me!!!"
<br><br>She made her wish! Me? Her boyfriend!!?? It was my first time receiving that kind of request so I was bit surprised but…… extremely delighted! It had been a year since I became a Devil, but it was my first time receiving that kind of request by a woman! I had finally done it!! I had finally become a man who was requested to do that kind of thing─
<br><br>I was in a garden full of flowers but…the two women before me ─ Rias and Akeno-san were filled with glaring aura. They had a smile on their face but released frightening aura and intense glares!!!
<br><br>[You…are my boyfriend, right?]
<br><br>[Ara, ara, how is my dear Husband going to respond to this?]
<br><br>I understood that these two, who would be my future wives, were asking this without speaking! But the client's wish was important too! When I was busy worrying, I noticed that all the members of the Occult Research Society, starting from the President had fainted.
<br><br>[I've put them to sleep with demonic power.]
<br><br>─The one who appeared while saying this was Ravel!!
<br><br>Ravel, who felt a bad premonition looking at the magic circle, immediately followed me. Thus everything ended without anything actually happening thanks to Ravel, who rushed to support me.
<br><br>─After this incident, Rias and her group visited several notable clubs and finally concluded there wasn't a single club they'd have liked to join. So, they established a new club, called [Japanese Culture Research Society] and said.
<br><br>[After everyone graduates, by all means, please join it].
<br><br>─And, we were already invited. Unexpectedly, the usual members all being in same club in college. I thought of such a future...─
