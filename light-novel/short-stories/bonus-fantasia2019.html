※ This story takes place before High School DxD Volume 10 – Lion Heart of the School Festival.
<b><br><br>♥ Koneko’s Situation
<br><br>Ise: “Now that I think about it, you were originally a Nekomata, but you don’t seem to be afraid of hot food, Koneko-chan.”
<br><br>Koneko: “…I’ve been practising.”
<br><br>Rias: “I would say that it’s all thanks to practice. When she initially became my servant, she couldn’t eat hot food at all.”
<br><br>Koneko: “…Not being able to eat hot food is a matter of life and death. Taiyaki, takoyaki, sukiyaki, yakiniku…I worked desperately to train my tongue (lick lick).”
<br><br>Rias: “On that topic, because she’s a Nekomata, there’s something that works very well, right? Here you go, Koneko.”
<br><br>Koneko: “Nya…nyan ♪”
<br><br>Ise: “Ooh, Koneko-chan instantly exposed her cat ears and tail! Buchou, what was the powder in that bag?”
<br><br>Rias: “Ufufu, it’s matatabi.”
<br><br>Ise: “Ah, matatabi! I see, it’s because she’s a cat.”
<br><br>Rias: “This is the only thing that she hasn’t gotten over yet. She seems to enjoy it though, so it’s not a bad thing.”
<br><br>Ise: (…If I use that, then I can do that with Koneko-chan…)
<br><br>Rias: You can’t use it for bad things, okay?
<br><br>Ise: Y-Yes! (I can never sneak anything past you, can I?)
<br><br>Koneko: “Nyan ♪ nyan ♪”
<br><br><br />
<br><br>♥ Xenovia’s Situation
<br><br>Xenovia: “Hmm, so this is written as [iron] huh. And this is in katakana so it can be read as [calcium].
<br><br>Ise: “Hey, Xenovia. What are you trying to look up in the dictionary?”
<br><br>Xenovia: “Ah, Ise. Well, I’ve been struggling to try and read this book.”
<br><br>Ise: “What!? Special magazine for pregnancy and childcare…[Egg Club]!? What kind of book are you reading!?”
<br><br>Xenovia: “Since I’ve decided to give birth to your children in the future, it’s vital for me to know what nutrients are necessary for a mother. By the way, the music for prenatal education will be Christian hymns.”
<br><br>Ise: “Both the mother and child will be hurt by that! Besides, reading such books can cause misunderstandings!”
<br><br>Asia: “Good day, Ise-san, Xenovia-san. Xenovia-san, what magazine are you looking at?”
<br><br>Xenovia: “Hmm, a magazine on parenting. It’s a great partner to have for peace of mind for my first time making one.”
<br><br>Asia: “P-Parenting, and your first time making one…? M-Moreover, you’re reading it together with Ise-san…!”
<br><br>Ise: “No, it’s a misunderstanding, Asia!”
<br><br>Rias, Akeno, Koneko: “““Ise, why don’t you come over and tell us more about this?”””
<br><br>Ise: “When did all of you come over here!? It’s over — I’m going to be killed!”
<br><br>Xenovia: “Hmm, it’s tough being a father too.”
<br><br><br />
<br><br>♥ Sona’s Situation
<br><br>Ise: “Ummm…wait a second!”
<br><br>Sona: “Is this the twentieth time? You asked me to teach you how to play chess. Please just give up and resign.”
<br><br>Ise: “Y-Yes…. Hmm, I feel like I could win in games other than chess…!”
<br><br>Sona: “I see, an interesting proposition. Then let’s have a match in the game that you think you’re best at. If you can win against me, then I’ll listen to anything you say.”
<br><br>Ise: “Really!? Alright! Then, let’s play shogi next!”
<br><br>Sona: “—Checkmate.”
<br><br>Ise: “Damn it! I got cornered! Next…let’s go with cards!”
<br><br>Sona: “—Royal Straight Flush.”
<br><br>Ise: “How on earth!? Hmm, then let’s try a fighting game next!”
<br><br>Sona: “—Hundred Combo Finish.”
<br><br>Ise: “Your button mashing is at a professional level! Since it’s come to this, I’ll just have to go with a card game!”
<br><br>Sona: “I special summon the Light-element Dragon God, Neo-Shining Dragon ZX, and perform a direct attack on my opponent’s Life Points.”
<br><br>Ise: “No! …T-This can’t be! I can’t win at all.”
<br><br>Sona: “Okay, what’s next? The puzzle games over here?”
<br><br>Ise: “Of course! I’m definitely going to win at least once!”
<br><br>Rias: (Every time Sona comes over to the Hyoudou residence, she looks so happy when she gets addicted to playing games with Ise.)
<br><br>Sona: “Fufufu, I’ll accompany you until the end with anything today.”
