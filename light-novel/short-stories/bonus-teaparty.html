<h1 style="color: red; text-align: center">Having a Mad Tea Party</h1><br><br>

<b><h2>Part 1</h2>
This happened in the Underworld, a little while after the Demonic Beast Riot had ended .
<br><br>......That day, I was trying to cope with the sensation of being in the wrong place.
<br><br>"How are you doing?"
<br><br>"How are you doing?"
<br><br>"Ohohoho, that is right".
<br><br>"───Is that so?"
<br><br>I was hearing such a splendid conversation.
<br><br>While putting a high-class looking teacup in my mouth, I was watching such a scene───
<br><br>"Be a little more elegant".
<br><br>The woman with crimson hair seated by my side───Rias warned me.
<br><br>"E-even if you say something like that...... I'm not used to this kind of atmosphere".
<br><br>"......I'll be troubled if you can't even conduct yourself at a tea party of High-class Devils".
<br><br>Rias said that while sounding a little displeased. That's right, as she said, I'm participating in a tea party for the sons and daughters of High-class Devils.
<br><br>Why did it become like this?
<br><br>To know why we'll have to go several hours back in time───
<br><br>On a holiday, a panicked Rias entered my room where I was relaxing.
<br><br>"......It's the first time I'm hearing about this schedule​, Grayfia!"
<br><br>She looked bewildered while holding the cellphone.
<br><br>"Eh? Did you notify me a week ago? It's that so? .....Because we were busy with various things lately, it looks like I did let it slide......and? The tea party is in 3 hours!?"
<br><br>Letting out a voice filled with surprise, Rias started restlessly walking here and there inside the room.
<br><br>......What happened? While I looked puzzled, it looked like the call with Grayfia-san ended.
<br><br>Rias tossed the phone at the bed while sighing.
<br><br>"......That's right, if I had stopped to think a little about it, I would have seen it coming. I'm in no position to say anything to Grayfia, as I didn't even realize it".
<br><br>"......What happened?"
<br><br>As I timidly tried to start a conversation───
<br><br>"We can't continue like this​!"
<br><br>While grabbing my hand, we flew out of the room!
<br><br>"Wa-wait! What happened, Rias!"
<br><br>Rias said to me, who was surprised at this sudden turn of events.
<br><br>"Ise, there's a tea party 3 hours from now ".
<br><br>"......A tea party, the kind where you drink black tea while chatting?"
<br><br>"Yes, one of those. It's an important tea party that I have to attend regularly. That’s why, I need you to attend it with me!"
<br><br>"......Ok, but, is it alright for me to come?"
<br><br>"Of course. Or rather, you are necessary!"
<br><br>───!! If your beloved woman were to say "You're necessary!" you'll lose the reason to refuse!
<br><br>As it is something sudden, I'm full of things I don't know, but......
<br><br>"Now, Ise! Go get dressed immediately!"
<br><br>30 minutes later, with my hair tightly made, I was dressed in noble clothes.
<br><br>With this, I joined the elegant tea party. The other members of the Occult Research Club should be fully enjoying their day off.
<br><br>The place is in the garden of a castle somewhere.
<br><br>In the large garden, the flowers were blossoming in full glory. The fountain statue , was splendidly made too.
<br><br>In the garden, several table seats were prepared, and an uncountable number of Western sweets were served. All of them looked expensive and delicious......!
<br><br>Those participating in this tea party are only the sons and daughters of pure-blooded High-class Devils. Everyone was from the upper class the day they were born.
<br><br>In the surroundings, there were several princesses dressed in flashy dresses; the men too, were tightly dressed in noble clothes, releasing a dazzling atmosphere.
<br><br>The number of maids waiting at the back was considerable too.
<br><br>...... Different from me, who only changed clothes in a hurry, the gentlemen attending this tea party were embodying what it means to be a "noble". From only a few words, one could feel elegance overflowing.
<br><br>......How should I put it? Somehow, the pairings of men and women were standing out. Or rather, there are many couples? There are groups with only men and women too, but the pairing of man and woman was overwhelmingly superior.
<br><br>We-well, in any case, I'll try to not embarrass Rias in this place.
<br><br>Just in case, on the occasion of the summer vacation training in the Underworld, I received the minimum​ of etiquette lessons in the Gremory castle, but......as I didn't attend this kind of event very much, I'll do the best I can.
<br><br>Using the tableware without making any sound is already the best I can do!
<br><br>While sitting at Rias’ side, who was elegantly dressed in a dress, I tried to not stand out as much as possible, but......
<br><br>"How are you doing, Rias-san? Ara, so this is the rumoured.....?"
<br><br>A group of women started talking with us, and their curious eyes were looking at me and not Rias.
<br><br>All of them are princess-sama’s from the upper class, right? Being seen by them makes me nervous......
<br><br>Rias introduced me with a radiant expression.
<br><br>"Yes, he is the Sekiryuutei Hyoudou Issei and my fiancé".
<br><br>Right, right, I'm the Sekiryuutei Hyoudou Issei, and Rias’ fiancé───When I thought until there, I became surprised inside my mind and shouted.
<br><br>"F-f-fiancé!!?"
<br><br>Rias quickly sealed my mouth with her hand and whispered into my ear.
<br><br>(Don't worry about that​, just follow this talk with me. Today, we are going with this setting).
<br><br>(Just follow the talk...... I mean, this kind of setting.....?)
<br><br>She nodded at my question.
<br><br>(Yes, this a tea party that should be attended while being accompanied by a fiancé too.)
<br><br>Seriously!? A-a tea party that should be attended while being accompanied by your fiancé, so that's the reason for having many pairs of men and women!?
<br><br>Rias started blushing and said.
<br><br>(...... F-for the time being, you confessed to me and I consented, so even if we say we are fiancés here, it wouldn't be weird, right?)
<br><br>C-certainly, I told Rias my feelings and she agreed. But to suddenly do something like attending a tea party for fiancés! In addition, a tea party for people of the upper class!
<br><br>As my role became clear today, I became even more nervous!
<br><br>As if advising me, Rias said.
<br><br>(Anyway, you just have to behave as my boyfriend today, alright?)
<br><br>(Understood. I'll manage it somehow!)
<br><br>Okay! The first impression is important! Look, the eyes of these women were filled with curiosity! While I cleared my throat and corrected my posture, I said formal​y.
<br><br>"S-sorry for delaying my introduction. I am Rias Gremory’s fi-fiancé, Hyoudou Issei".
<br><br>Just when I said that, a woman joined her hands with a radiant​ face.
<br><br>"It's me who should apologise. It's an honour meeting you, Sekiryuutei-sama!"
<br><br>A person on the side of this woman said this too.
"I've heard rumours about you for some time now​. It was about a young, reincarnated Devil who made several meritorious deeds​. Like this time you contributed in repelling the Demonic Beasts and other various achievements".
<br><br>"It's wonderful. I've watched it on the news and TV programs. You are immensely popular among the citizens of my territory".
<br><br>I-I see. She knows me and she knows everyone from the news and that tokusatsu program.
<br><br>These Princess-sama’s came talking to me joyfully.
<br><br>"My ani is a Rating Game player, but he greatly praised Sekiryuutei-sama’s way of fighting".
<br><br>"Y-yes, a-about that, thank you......".
<br><br>"Later, if you are able, then please come to my territory. We would be happy if we can host a parade or a show for the citizens".
<br><br>"If there's the opportunity, then by all means".
<br><br>I was surrounded by these onee-san's with beautiful faces and appearances! If it's just looking by the side, I should look popular. But I was doing my best just trying not to behave rudely towards them!
<br><br>On the side, Rias was talking with another onee-san.
<br><br>"Looks like my father wants to negotiate with Rias-san’s father about a new type of joint commerce establishment".
<br><br>"Yes, I was told about it too. Let's hope for the improvement of each other’s territories".
<br><br>Several questions were thrown at me and Rias, but we somehow overcame it.
<br><br>.....Being Rias’ fiancé...is probably a considerable position! The younger sister of the Maou and the next family head of the noble family, Gremory. To take the position of her future husband, one should be quite the individual.
<br><br>......Yes, but it’s not bad. No, or rather, this is the best! Being the fiancé of my beloved woman is already enough happiness, it's an honour!
<br><br>In this way, if I were to really become her fiancé, how much of a happy thing that would be!
<br><br>No, I want to someday marry this person! For that reason, something like the tea party of today, as Rias’ fiancé I'll accomplish it splendidly!
<br><br>"Then, goodbye Rias-san, Sekiryuutei-sama".
<br><br>"Yes, goodbye".
<br><br>When I was motivating myself inside my mind, the conversation with these women ended.
<br><br>Fu─For the time being, we overcame the conversation now. Although I was quite stiff.
<br><br>Pointing at the group of women leaving, Rias gave a supplementary explanation.
<br><br>"That one is from the Berith family, the other is from Sallos family. Now, that child on the right who started a friendly chat at the table is from the Focalor family, the one on the left is from the Oriax family───"
<br><br>Rias said the family names of those Princess-sama’s. I somehow have heard those names before. That means that those Princess-sama's are related to the ex-72 Pillars High-class Devils.
<br><br>"You should remember this, because you'll probably meet them again".
<br><br>Rias said so, but...... Seriously? I'll meet those people again? Me? Are you saying that I'll have to attend this kind of tea party again......?
<br><br>At any rate, just as Rias said, I recorded the names and faces of those women in my brain.
<br><br>After that, Rias and I walked around every table while greeting and exchanging friendly chats with those ladies and gentlemen.
<br><br>.....Well, I tried to not expose my true character as much as possible​......
<br><br>Then───
<br><br>"Ara, isn't that Rias-san? How are you doing?"
<br><br>Rias was called as we turned our faces towards the direction of the voice. There, a woman with strict eyes was standing there, while holding a high-class looking vibrantly​ coloured feathered folding fan in her hand.
<br><br>This woman asked me in an arrogant way.
<br><br>"This gentleman is the Sekiryuutei-san? I heard that those at the bottom became extremely obsessed with that vulgar tokusatsu program".
<br><br>......Different from those princess-samas from before, this one is clearly directing her evil intent towards here. The instant that this woman arrived, the people in the surroundings suddenly stopped their talk and started looking at the situation here.
<br><br>Rias too narrowed her eyes at her arrival and responded.
<br><br>"How are you doing? This is the first in a long time​, right? Eneely-san, there are many people who are looking forward to that tokusatsu program, you know?"
<br><br>Rias just responded normally. The woman───Eneely-san smiled fearlessly.
<br><br>"Ara, ara, Rias-san, I was being rude. My mood​ was unintentionally raised by meeting the legendary dragon, you know?"
<br><br>The voice and attitude of this person was the exact opposite of the words she said...... This person, does she have something against me or Rias?
<br><br>When I was thinking like that───
<br><br>"Although you're a legendary dragon, you're a former human. Eneely thought that you would be feeling pressured by the atmosphere of this tea party and came to talk to you".
<br><br>From the back, a man holding a wine glass ​came walking. It was a purple-haired man with a noble appearance; however, he was directing an unpleasant smile and attitude towards here.
<br><br>He has an attitude exactly like Riser from when I meet him for the first time. He was looking down on me with an arrogant attitude.
<br><br>"Looks like you have something to say about my boyfriend, Iolova-san".
<br><br>To Rias’ words, the man───Iolova-san gave a bitter smile.
<br><br>"I was being rude. It's the person that the younger sister of the Maou-sama chose after all. So, someone like me isn't in the position of saying anything. Eneely, the time for that event is coming. We were the ones to arrange this plan so we need to prepare ourselves".
<br><br>"That’s right. Rias-san, Sekiryuutei-san, today especially, we prepared something wonderful for this tea party. So enjoy yourselves until the end".
<br><br>Leaving only these words, the man and woman left.
<br><br>"......Who was that couple.....?"
<br><br>I asked Rias.
<br><br>"The man was the second son of the Amon household───Iolova Amon. The woman is a candidate to be the next family head of the Vassago household, Eneely Vassago. The two of them are engaged".
<br><br>Although Rias was acting normal, she let out a deep sigh.
<br><br>Heh───so they're engaged, it probably was decided by those from the upper class of both sides.
<br><br>"Vassago was the 3rd in the former 72 Pillars, right? Her house has quite a high social standing, right?"
<br><br>Rias nodded at my question. Originally it was the noble family coming after the Great King Bael; who is 1st, and the Archduke Agares in 2nd. Because even now, the obsession with the rankings that existed in the past in the Underworld is deeply-rooted. Such things as the influence of the former 3rd should be quite strong?
<br><br>Actually, when that girl arrived, the other Princess-sama’s couldn't hide their nervous appearance.
<br><br>Looking at Eneely, who was snuggling up to Iolova, the number of people who became stiff were many. Because it's a tea party gathering the sons and daughters of nobles, they probably can't just ignore her.
<br><br>Hey, that Iolova man from Amon household too, certainly​ his family was part of the one-digit High-class Devils, right?
<br><br>A top-class couple, is it? That's why the eyes surrounding those two are amazing.
<br><br>"Originally, Eneely and Iolova already had that type of attitude. But their loathing towards us became stronger after the incident with Astaroth───Because her house; Vassago, holds a friendly relationship with the House of Astaroth".
<br><br>Rias explained it like this.
<br><br>Astaroth is───a High-class Devil clan who produced individuals like Diodora and the Maou Ajuka Beelzebub-sama. Because the next family head, Diodora, helped terrorists, the house itself suffered a considerable penalty. After that, they started being looked at with reproach​ by the masses.
<br><br>Because of that, this arrogant princess-sama───Eneely, bared her hostility towards us?
Hmm, I'm not fully satisfied with this. The bad one was Diodora. Well, it's not like everyone from the Astaroth household is bad. I was under the care of the Maou Ajuka Beelzebub-sama too.
<br><br>Well, the two household's seemed to have an ancient relationship; so that side too, should have its complicated circumstances and self-interests.
<br><br>Rias apologized to me, who was tilting my head at these complicated feelings.
<br><br>"I'm sorry. I should have informed you that this kind of thing would happen in advance. Every house that was one-digit from the former 72 Pillars are obsessed───They strongly hold to their past influence".
<br><br>"No, I don't care. For me, just playing the role of your fiancé today is already something to feel honoured about".
<br><br>I just expressed my feelings honestly​. It's alright, I'm already used to being looked down on or being loathed by nobles.
<br><br>Hearing my words, Rias showed a radiant smile saying "Thank you".<br><br>

<h2>Part 2</h2>
2 hours after the start of the tea Party, when the exhaustion from the atmosphere of this place started to accumulate, suddenly a wave of applause started.
<br><br>Rias and I looked at the direction of where the applause was occurring and───there was the couple from before, Eneely Vassago and Iolova Amon standing on a stage.
<br><br>Behind the two of them, we could see something huge covered in cloth, but...... a low growl could be heard.
<br><br>"Everyone, today I, Eneely Vassago and Iolova Amon, will make a special presentation for you".
<br><br>While saying that Eneely gave instructions​ to the butlers​ who were waiting. The butlers took out the cloth covering the thing, and there was an extra-large cage.
<br><br>Inside the cage was───a huge monster dog.
<br><br>It had 3 heads, a huge Demonic beast. I know this monster.
<br><br>"Cerberus......?"
<br><br>I murmured unconsciously and Eneely showed a proud smile.
<br><br>"It's not just a Cerberus. He was born as the result of the mating between a Cerberus and another watchdog​ from hell, the Demonic Dog; Garum".
<br><br>Demonic Dog; Garum......? And mating.....?
<br><br>I already have seen a Cerberus before, that's why it certainly looks a little different. I mean, It has four eyes!
<br><br>It has three heads and four eyes in each of them! There are 12, sharp shining eyes! It turned
its eerily, brutal line of sight towards us.
<br><br>Everyone from the surroundings too; were surprised and creeped out by this bizarre demonic dog.
<br><br>Eneely became excited about this response.
<br><br>"Ufufufu, his name is Bob. For this kind of occasion, a simple name is better than a noble one, you know?"
<br><br>Bob!? What an unexpectedly friendly name! I thought that these owners of his would give it a
more exaggerated flashy name. But, I don't know what those nobles think.
<br><br>.....H-hey, about Bob-kun, no matter how you look at it, it wasn't domesticated​. I mean, he's baring his bloodlust and hostility at everyone. I can feel an amazing pressure.
<br><br>As I was looking at this demonic dog───Bob, who could be a little dangerous, Iolova showed an unpleasant smile.
<br><br>"Hey, Sekiryuutei-dono. From the moment you looked at this demonic dog, your complexion became a little unwell?"
<br><br>"W-well, it's a good demonic dog".
<br><br>I said so with a stiff smile. It's not like I'm afraid of it, I just don't want to deal with a pet, and I'm not in the position to say this right into his face.
<br><br>......How should I put it, this demonic dog is looking only at the women in this garden.....?
<br><br>While I was feeling like that, Iolova ordered the butlers.
<br><br>"If he is being connected by the chains made by my clan’s characteristic demonic power, we probably won't have any problems, release him from his cage".
<br><br>Hearing Iolova orders, the butlers looked a little perplexed but took the demonic dog, Bob out of its cage!
<br><br>OI, oi, oi, is it really alright? His eyes are just too wicked, and the aura enveloping his body is atrocious.
<br><br>The huge demonic dog approached us. Iolova ordered the Cerberus, Bob.
<br><br>"Sit, Bob".
<br><br>Although​ he was instructed to do so, Bob-kun didn't show even a hint of moving.
Iolova raised his voice, "Sit, Sit!"
<br><br>After being ordered several times, Bob finally sat down. Seeing this the other sons and daughters raised cheering voices.
<br><br>Well, at least he seems to have been trained to this extent.
<br><br>Next, Eneely ordered 『Give me your paw』───
<br><br>In an instant, the 12 eyes of Bob shone in sharp red light and at the same time, something
like a bright red beam of light was shot out from his eyes!
<br><br>What was in the direction he shot was───
<br><br>A princess-sama from somewhere wearing a dress!
<br><br>This woman was unable to do anything, and her whole body was bathed in the red beam of light!
<br><br>Is she alright? She was bathed in light, that's a Devil's weakness. I was worried, but......
<br><br>"Kyaaa!!"
<br><br>After a short scream───and suddenly, the dress of this woman exploded​! What appeared was the graceful naked body of a woman! Splendid! It was a scene so to say......
<br><br>Furthermore, Bob continued to release the mysterious beam from his 12 eyes aiming only at the women!
<br><br>"Nooo!!"
<br><br>"My dress!!"
<br><br>"Iiyann!!"
<br><br>The clothes of the women everywhere on the grounds of the tea Party were being destroyed!
<br><br>......Seeing it, I thought that it was impressive! Amazing! Dress Break Beam version!
Furthermore, the one using it is a Cerberus!
<br><br>T-this is something that he can do......?
<br><br>As expected, it's because he's a half demonic dog Garum something, that he has this unique ability?
<br><br>"Hey, Bob! Stop it! This is not 『Giving your paw』! This is!
<br><br>"『Pleasure』, did you forget it!? It's bad to use this here!"
<br><br>Iolova was acting flustered! You, you taught this kind of 『Pleasure』order to a Cerberus!? Furthermore, you disciplined it to release a beam of light that blew up clothes from its 12 eyes!?
<br><br>I feel like respecting you, if only a little!
<br><br>"Uwoo!!"
<br><br>Ah... Even the clothes of the men in this place were being blown up. I see, it's not like me, who's limited to only women. It's just a technique that if it's cloth, it'll blow up anything...... I can't feel obsession! It's not beautiful! I feel a little disappointed! As expected, I won't respect you! I'll only praise you for this ingenious idea!
<br><br>"Wait, Iolova! What's the meaning of this!"
<br><br>Eneely was furious! It looks like she didn't know that her fiancé taught such an indecent technique to the demonic dog! Seeing the expression of anger of his lover, Iolova became pale-faced.
<br><br>"N-no, wait Eneely! Hear me out!! This has deep circumstances!"
<br><br>"What kind of deep​ circumstances can it have! What kind of order is this『Pleasure』!? T-to think that you would create such an indecent technique......! Because we aren't the 『Oppai Dragon』and 『Switch Princess』couple who is right there, could you not do such an
embarrassing thing like this!?"
<br><br>Eneely said while pointing her finger at us! I'm sorry for being an embarrassing couple!
<br><br>With the beams of the demonic dog flying everywhere, the clothes of the people all throughout the venue were blown up! Starting with the sons and daughters, the butlers and maid-san’s too were made completely nude! What a beautiful sight! I saved it in my brain.
<br><br>That's right, something like a Dress Break Beam version isn’t so bad!
<br><br>While I was making a new discovery, Iolova continued to make excuse​s to his fiancé.
<br><br>"I just became encouraged when I heard that a Low-class Devil, Sekiryuutei, created a technique which blew away women’s clothes ! It was not elegant for me, a High-class Devil to learn it. But wouldn't it be possible to teach it to my familiar or pet? Do you understand this feeling? Eneely!"
<br><br>"I don't understand what you are saying, Iolova! Why did you have to create that extremely indecent technique!?"
<br><br>Eneely was enraged, but Iolova said with extreme pride.
<br><br>"A person who covers her body in gorgeous clothing becomes nude in an instant. In that instant, ephemeral beauty and the beauty of exposing oneself as one was born coexist. This is art!"
<br><br>Hearing Iolova’s insistence, Eneely's feelings surpassed anger and she became dumbfounded. No, I understand the feelings of this Iolova guy!
<br><br>"............Although our positions and situation are different, It's frustrating to think that I understand even a little why Rias-san thought about cancelling her engagement with Riser-san......!"
<br><br>While folding her fan, Eneely said frustrated!
<br><br>Iolova who heard this started panicking.
<br><br>"Th-that can't be! If Eneely were to abandon me what am I going to do!? I-I u-understand! After stopping Bob, let's talk! Bob! That's enough, just stop! Can’t you hear what I'm saying!?"
<br><br>Iolova kicked the foreleg of his pet, who continued to release beams even now.
<br><br>Donn!
<br><br>The demonic dog counterattacked and without pity, stepped on his owner! Arara, he was stepped on and flattened! This dog wasn't disciplined even a little!
<br><br>The butlers and soldiers, who were standing by, tried to stop the Cerberus, but─── it looks like not even one of them has the ability to stop it.
<br><br>"Ise!"
<br><br>Rias called my name while protecting the participants of this tea Party. To call my name in this situation, that can only mean one thing, right?
<br><br>"Understood! I'll stop him! Rias, take everyone to a safe place".
<br><br>I manifested my gauntlet swiftly and started the counter to Balance Breaker!
<br><br>"I didn't even think that I would have to fight in this tea party, but for the time being; Balance Breaker!"
<br><br>Red aura covered my body, taking the form of a powerful armour!
<br><br>"A doggy who doesn't listen to what it’s owner said needs to be disciplined!"
<br><br>With aura overflowing my fist, I charged at the Demonic dog───
<br><br>Several minutes later, the demonic dog, who fell asleep immediately, was put inside the cage.
<br><br>Well, something like this is child’s play. The couple responsible for this, Eneely and Iolova, were apologising to the participants of the tea party with a depressed appearance.
<br><br>"......Thank you very much for stopping Bob. And I'm sorry, because of us......".
<br><br>"...... As expected of the next family head of Gremory and the Sekiryuutei. I want to apologise for my impoliteness​".
<br><br>Arara, they completely lost their malice. Or rather, they're just awfully dejected. It can't be helped, their prided demonic dog showered the members of this tea party with a technique like that, so they probably lost face.
<br><br>While sighing, Rias said "It's alright" and generously forgave them. As expected of the woman I fell for! What a big heart!
<br><br>Eneely poked Iolova with her elbow​.
<br><br>"If we were to say from the beginning, it's your fault Iolova! When I thought that you created such a rare demonic dog, you went and taught it such an indecent technique!"
<br><br>"For that reason​, Eneely. There's beauty in there! I want you to understand this somehow! Rias-san accepted the lewdness of the Sekiryuutei! Eneely too, can't you give it your approval​!?"
<br><br>"Just apologise for causing trouble for others! Anyway, when we go back I'll give you a scolding!"
<br><br>Eneely took Iolova away by pulling his ear. Arara, this one is the type who dominates her husband.
<br><br>In the end, the tea party ended with this. It was decided that it'll be hosted again someday in the future......
<br><br>If those people were to attend it from now on too; unexpectedly, it could become something terrible again.
<br><br>Well, because it isn't very unlikely that we can open our hearts to each other, we just need to get along gradually.
<br><br>When we were going back, Rias apologised to me.
<br><br>"I'm sorry, it became something like this......"
<br><br>"No, it's not your fault. Besides, it was quite a fresh​ experience".
<br><br>Those were my honest feelings. It was a disaster, but to participate in a tea party of the sons and daughters of those of the upper class was a fresh​ experience.
<br><br>The feeling of never wanting to participate in it again didn't arise.
<br><br>Gyuh.
<br><br>Rias hugged my arm.
<br><br>"But, you were really cool. As expected of my fiancé".
